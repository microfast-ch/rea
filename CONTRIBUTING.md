# Contributing

## Contributor License Agreement
In order to keep rea alive, we plan to release a SaaS offering and to provide commercial extensions to rea.

As this is still in planning, we want to prevent to run into licensing issues in the future,
therefore we are requiring signed CLAs for contributions, despite we are not a fan of this.

The two CLAs are:
- [Individual Contributors](./CLA-Individual.md)
- [Corporate Contributors](./CLA-Entity.md)
